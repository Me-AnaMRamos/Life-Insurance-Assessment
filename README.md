# Multilayer Perceptron for Life Insurance Assessment
This repository focuses on developing a deep neural network model to predict risk ratings for life insurance applicants.

## Project Overview
The core of this project lies in the Life_Insurance_Assessment.ipynb notebook, where the development and implementation of the predictive model take place. Additionally, we offer an interactive learning experience through the LIA_Hyperparameter_tutorial.ipynb notebook. This tutorial guides users through the process of building and optimizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model step by step, offering graded exercises to reinforce understanding.

### Interactive Tutorial
* File: LIA_Hyperparameter_tutorial.ipynb <br/>
  Description: This notebook provides an interactive lab experience, guiding users through the implementation of an MLP model 
  for risk prediction. Users can follow along with guided exercises to deepen their understanding of the model-building process.

* File: LIA_Hyperparameter_tutorial_Solution.ipynb <br/>
  Description: This notebook presents the solutions to the exercises provided in the interactive tutorial, offering users a reference point to compare their own implementations.
### Hyperparameter Tuning
Folders with names containing "Tuner" contain optimal hyperparameter values obtained through searches for different models. These folders serve as valuable resources for fine-tuning the models and reproduce the obtained results.
